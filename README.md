## AED_PROJECT - MOBILE CLINIC

# Hospital On Wheels


Mobile Clinic System was a project that I developed during my Application Modelling and Design course at Northeastern University.

A hospital on wheels is a mobile van administered by the NU Nursing School that travels between cities to care for high-risk patients. The primary goal is to monitor and control the spread of infectious illness among this high-risk group. Nursing professors and students make up the newly mobile clinical team. When the team opens up shop in different areas, they accept patients on a first-come, first-served basis. The patient is then visited by a nurse, the major complaint is noted, vital signs are collected, a diagnosis is made, lab tests are submitted to the lab, and episodes of contiguous disease are documented. All events must be planned ahead of time and linked to a funding campaign.
